# Particle_Filtering
Particle filtering uses a set of samples to represent the posterior distribution of some stochastic process given noisy and/or partial observations. The state-space model can be nonlinear and the initial state and noise distributions can take any form required. Particle filter techniques provide a well-established methodology[1][3][4]for generating samples from the required distribution without requiring assumptions about the state-space model or the state distribution
